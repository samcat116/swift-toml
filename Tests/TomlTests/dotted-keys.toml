# Dotted keys (TOML 0.5+)

# Simple dotted keys
name.first = "Tom"
name.last = "Preston-Werner"

# Deeply nested
site.google.analytics.id = "UA-12345"

# With quotes
site."title" = "My Blog"
site.'tagline' = 'A blog about stuff'

# Equivalent to creating nested tables
physical.color = "orange"
physical.shape = "round"

# Mixed with table syntax
[fruit]
apple.color = "red"
apple.taste.sweet = true

# With spaces around dots (allowed in TOML)
a . b . c = 1
d .e. f = 2

# Equivalent representations
# These two are the same:
product.name = "Hammer"
product.sku = 738594937

# As this table:
# [product]
# name = "Hammer"  
# sku = 738594937
